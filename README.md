## ðŸ“š Project Wiki
This project is a guide for the [R36H and R36S handheld retro consoles](https://github.com/smartin77/retro-gaming-consoles-r36/wiki).  
Since I own an Boyhom R36H and have gone through the process of updating, configuring, and customizing it, Iâ€™d like to share my findings and knowledge gathered along the way.
